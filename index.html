          Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] (listen);
          30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter
          who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of
          Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks,
          including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years
          of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and
          self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic,
          impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations
          of modern art. However, he was not commercially successful, and his
          suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

I would describe preprocessing as plug and play css, being able to make one statement regarding multiple components and applying it
is a neat and efficient way of programming.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

Favorite concept of preprocessing would have to be the variables applying properties to a single tag then using that tag to apply to multiple
elements but also make it unique is pretty cool.

How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

I would explain the concept of a variable as applying a set of properties to a single name and using it for multiple elements while being able
to change the properties

What is the purpose of using functions in code?

Running functions in code is one of the building blocks of programs. Sectioning of parts of code to run specific tasks that can be used multiple times to avoid
repetition in code.

What is a JSON data?

JSON data is how information is formatted in a way that is easier to read. Parsing data into a format that is readable and mutable  is crucial
to object oriented programming.
